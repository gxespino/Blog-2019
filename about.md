<p>I'm a software engineer based in Washington DC. Formerly, I was a registered nurse specializing in mental health and orthopedic post op care. A few years ago I turned a lifelong hobby into a second career.

<p>This site features articles regarding coding, nursing, and startups - also occasional essays on topics I'm interested in, which could pretty much be anything.</p>

<h3>How I work</h3>
<p>I enjoy leveling up developers around me and enjoy pair programming both in person and remotely.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I'm a proponent of TDD, SRP, object oriented and domain driven design. I enjoy design patterns and code abstractions but have come to learn the value of pragmatism through the years, often switching to 'Get Shit Done' mode when the situation warrants it.</p>

<p>Most days I strive to be a git commit perfectionist. I work to elevate documentation and git standards on every team I'm on.</p>

<p>My prized possession is a signed copy of Sandi Metz's POODR. One time I almost got into a car crash from being overly excited after listening to a programming podcast and realizing they were talking about one of my blog posts.</p>

<p>I like hefeweizens, despise stouts and enjoy the occasional injection of deadpan and sarcasm. Disclaimer: I am that geek in your office with a mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>Overtime I've come to realize that being a good software engineer is as much about being able to communicate clearly and effectively as it is pounding out code. The former is oftentimes much more challenging.</p>

<h3>Can I hire you?</h3>
<p>Yes. As of June 2019, I will have been on a sabbatical of indeterminante length. During this time I am dedicated to learning new languages, finishing up side projects and focusing on open source. Even still, I am open to exploring positions at fast paced, early stage (< 75 employees) startups, preferably in the SaaS or healthcare space.</p>

<p>I have extensive experience with meeting tight deadlines, fast iteration sprints, and optimizing for customer success. I'm the founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Alexandria-Code-Coffee/">Alexandria Code & Coffee</a> where developers reach out and mentor new developers.</p>
